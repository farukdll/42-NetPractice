# 42-NetPractice
NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

The networks you will be working with in this project are not real networks. They will be accessible via a training interface that you open in your web browser.

Only IPv4 addresses are used in NetPractice.

### What are TCP/IP addresses and how do they work?
```     
  . TCP/IP, in full Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol,
    standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances.
        
  . TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data,
    TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination,
    which remains active until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets,
    while ensuring end-to-end delivery without loss of any data.
