# 42-NetPractice
NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

The networks you will be working with in this project are not real networks. They will be accessible via a training interface that you open in your web browser.

Only IPv4 addresses are used in NetPractice.

### What are TCP/IP addresses and how do they work?
```     
  . TCP/IP, in full Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol,
    standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances.
        
  . TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data,
    TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination,
    which remains active until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets,
    while ensuring end-to-end delivery without loss of any data.

### What is IP address
```
  . IP addresses are the addresses required to connect to the internet.
    It is not possible for your device using the internet without an IP address to connect to the internet.
    Thanks to IP addresses, computers find each other and perform data flow.
    Public IP and private IP addresses are used for this.
