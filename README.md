# 42-NetPractice
NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

The networks you will be working with in this project are not real networks. They will be accessible via a training interface that you open in your web browser.

Only IPv4 addresses are used in NetPractice.
<!--
### What are TCP/IP addresses and how do they work?
```     
- TCP/IP, in full Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol,
  standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers 
  to communicate over long distances.
        
- TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network.
  Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and 
  its destination, which remains active until communication begins. 
  It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets,
  while ensuring end-to-end delivery without loss of any data.

### What is Transmission Control Protocol
```
- TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network.
  Before it transmits data, 
  TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination,
  which remains active until communication begins. 
  It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets,
  while ensuring end-to-end delivery without loss of any data.
    
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a protocol that allows communication 
  between computers to be carried out in small packets and lossless. In fact,
  the most important feature of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
  protocol is that it performs the authentication and execution of the data 
  when sending or receiving data from the other party. 
  The TCP protocol was written to hide the losses that occur in 
  advanced computer networks.
```
### What is IP address
```
- IP addresses are the addresses required to connect to the internet.
  It is not possible for your device using the internet without an 
  IP address to connect to the internet.
  Thanks to IP addresses, computers find each other and perform data flow.
  Public IP and private IP addresses are used for this.
```

</p>

### What is a Public IP Address?
```
- The IP address that allows two computers to recognize each other is 
  called a public IP address.
  A public IP address is usually used to access the Internet. 
  With a public IP address,
  you can access your computer or other electronic devices remotely.
```
### Public IP address ranges
```
- 1 IP address can have up to 255 values.
- Returns to 0 after 255.

. 0 (binary: 00000000)
. 1 (binary: 00000001)
. 2 (binary: 00000010)
. 3 (binary: 00000011)
. ...
. ...
. ...
. 252 (binary: 11111100)
. 253 (binary: 11111101)
. 254 (binary: 11111110)
. 255 (binary: 11111111)

BINARY  | 0000000 - 1111111
DECIMAL | 0 - 127

- For example
             IP address | 104.198.241.125
             IP address | 01101000.11000110.11110001.01111101

- Public IP addresses cannot take values from private IP addresses, 
  they only take values different from private IP address values.
```
### What is a Private IP Address?
```
- The IP address that several devices create when they are connected to 
  each other wired or wirelessly is called a private IP address.
  Devices on this network are not assigned the same IP address.
  Each is assigned a different IP address and these IP addresses 
  cannot be repeated.
  Computers on different networks can use the same addresses.
  It's okay if they use the same address since they're on different networks.
  There is also an incentive to use private IP addresses to save data.
  With private IP addresses, 
  it is not possible to route or stream data from the internet.
  The assignment of these addresses is also not controlled by anyone.
```
### Private IP address ranges
`10.0.0.0    – 10.255.255.255 `<br>
`172.16.0.0  – 172.31.255.255 `<br>
`192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`<br>
`127.0.0.0   – 127.255.255.255`
### What is IP masking
```
- In TCP/IP, two devices can tell if they are on the same network by looking 
  at the first few digits of each other's IP addresses. 
  This step is called the IP mask or Subnet mask (IP mask or Subnet Mask). 
  For example, if the IP mask is 255.255.255.0, two machines 
  with the same first three digits (ie first 24 bits) are on the same network. 
  In this case, 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 are on the same network, and 
  192.168.1.1 is on another network.
  
  
***
- DECIMAL
        IP address | 104.198.241.125
        Mask       | 255.255.255.128
  
- BINARY
        IP address | 01101000.11000110.11110001.01111101
        Mask       | 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
```

</p>

### Connection-switch
```
- A switch connects multiple devices together in a single network. 
  Unlike a router, the switch does not have any interfaces since it only 
  distributes packets to its local network, 
  and cannot talk directly to a network outside of its own.
```

### Key-example

</p>

### Router
```
- Just as the switch connects multiple devices on a single network, 
  the router connects multiple networks together. 
  The router has an interface for each network it connects to.

- Since the router separates different networks, 
  the range of possible IP addresses on one of its interfaces must 
  not overlap with the range of its other interfaces. An overlap in the 
  IP address range would imply that the interfaces are on the same network.
```

  Here we have two separate networks, each consisting of two computers. <br>
  In order to make it work, the two computers need to be part of the same network. <br>
  Because the mask of A and B is ``255.255.255.0` the possible IP-adresses of A1 are <br>`104.99.23.1 - 104.99.23.254`.<br>
  For C and D the mask is `255.255.0.0`, so the usable IP's are `211.191.0.1 - 211.191.255.254`

  Here we have two separate networks again, but this time we need to set the mask and IP correctly.<br>
  For the network of A and B, they need the same mask, `255.255.255.224`.<br>
  The available IP-addresses for A1 are `192.168.57.193 - 192.168.57.221`.<br>


  Network C and D already has the same mask. so they just need addresses that are part of the same subnet.<br>
  In the case of the mask beeing `/30` the subnet only consists of 2 available addresses per subnet.<br>
  So be carefull, to choose the correct ones. to make things easier,<br>
  i suggest you either start with the lowest or highest subnet.<br>
  I choose the highest, so my available IP-range is `192.168.57.253 - 192.168.57.254`

  In this level we have our first encounter with a [Key example](https://github.com/farukdll/42-NetPractice#Key-example).<br>
  Since we can't manipulate the mask of C, `255.255.255.128` will be the mask of the whole network.<br>
  A has a fix IP, so the whole networks range will be `104.198.187.1 - 104.198.187.126`.

  This is our first time running into a router, since the router does not connect to anything else,<br>
  there is no routing table, that needs to be worked with.<br>
  A has a fixed IP, so this will define the IP of our network.<br>
  You can freely choose a fitting mask for the network, but the subnet has to have at least 3 usable IP-addresses, <br> 
  so choosing `255.255.255.240`/`/28` will create a subnet of 14 usable addresses.<br>
  The fixed IP of A is `67.52.110.132`.<br>
  This results in a available IP-range of `67.52.110.129 - 67.52.110.142`.

  Here we first come by the mighty routing table.<br>
  R1 has a fixed IP of `80.103.79.126` and a fixed mask of `255.255.255.128`, <br>
  which results in a mask of `255.255.255.128` and an IP-range of `80.103.79.1 - 80.103.79.125` for A1.
  
  
  Now to conquer the routing table of A it is as easy as setting the **destination** as `default` <br> 
  or `0.0.0.0/0` and the destination has to be the IP of the directly connected router R1, `80.103.79.126`.<br>

  <br>
  This level introduces us to the Internet.<br>
  We again start with looking at the fixed IP-addresses and masks.


  IP of A1 is fixed and mask of R1, which A1 is connected to through the switch, is fixed as well.<br>
  So we need to match those in order for them to be in the same network.<br>
  Mask for this network will be `255.255.255.128` which then will result in 2 subnets.<br>
  Combined with the fixed IP of `29.65.6.227` one subnet will be from `29.65.6.1` to `29.65.6.126` and <br>
  the other <br>`29.65.6.129 - 29.65.6.254`.<br>
  In order for R1 and A1 to be in the same network, the possible address-range of R1 will be `29.65.6.129 - 29.65.6.254`.
  
  Now set the routing table of A in order to reach R1.


  The **destination** of the routing table of the internet needs to be set to the network address <br> 
  of the R1-A1 network, which in this case is `29.65.6.128`, combined with the CIDR of the network, which is `/25`.<br>
  This results in a **next hop** of `29.65.6.128/25`.


  **Destination** of the routing table of the router can be set to `default` or `0.0.0.0/0`.
